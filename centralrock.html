            <h2>Central Rock Gym</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
            <p>The last gym I went to is the only gym that is not owned by Rock Spot Climbing. Central Rock Gym has locations all across the country, and one of them is in Warwick. The only thing that kept me from getting a membership here was the location, it takes at least 30 minutes for me to get there from campus or my house. Besides that, this was my favorite gym out of the four I visited.</p>
            <p>They have a room dedicated to strength training, and I was very impressed with it. They have squat racks, benches, bands, dumbbells, cardio equipment, some other random pieces of equipment, a campus board, a tension board, and a spray wall. A tension board is similar to the moon and kilter boards that the other gyms have, and a spray wall is another endurance wall that just has as many different holds as they can fit on. It looked nicer than some of the gyms I have seen in high schools. There is also a room dedicated to yoga, which is not something that I usually do but I know a lot of climbers that love it. For people looking for more than just a climbing gym, this is the place.</p>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
            <p>In the climbing section, they have lead climbing, top rope, a couple of auto belays, and a lot of different bouldering sections. The lead climbing and top rope wall goes through the middle of the gym, and while watching other people climb it looked like there were options for all skill levels. There were only two auto belays that I saw in this section, and then a smaller auto belay area with smaller walls that looked like it was for birthday parties. I had a lot of fun bouldering here. They have specific sections for overhang, slab, and cave. The routes might be graded a bit higher than they actually are, but I know that may be subjective and someone else could disagree with me. I bounced around from wall to wall when I got tired of a certain style and always found something I wanted to do.</p>
            <p>Besides the location, the only other gripe I have with this location is that it does feel like a chain. The Rock Spot Climbing gyms all have a local, almost cozy feel, while Central Rock feels like you are in a modern climbing chain. I have no problem with these modern gyms, they are typically the ones that have more space and bigger gyms, but the vibes are always a little better in a more homey gym.</p>
