            <h2>Rock Spot Climbing: Peace Dale</h2>
            <p>Like I mentioned on the home page, it was important for me to find a gym that was close to campus and my house because I do not have time to drive 30 minutes to get to the gym every time I want to climb. Even with traffic, Rock Spot Climbing in Peace Dale is only a fifteen minute drive from either campus or my house. The first time I visited I knew I wanted to get my membership here not only because of its location, but because the gym itself is great.</p>
            <p>For parking it is a bit of a choose-your-own adventure; there is a lot when you first pull in, then some parallel spots as you drive closer to the building along the wall, and some spots in front of Whalers. I think there is enough parking for the space, so no one is going to be left without a place to park. It was a bit confusing the first time I went just because I wasn’t sure where I was going, but it made sense pretty quickly. The gym is right next to Whalers Brewing Company, I haven’t been able to stop in yet but I hear people talking all the time about going to Whalers after their climb to grab a drink. This isn’t a perk for the under twenty-one crowd, but as someone who is twenty-one I am looking forward to trying it out one day.</p>
            <p>When you first walk into the gym, there is a small lobby with a couch and a coffee table, the front desk, and the gear shop. The gear shop has a good selection of shirts, shoes, chalk, and pretty much anything else a climber may need, and the membership discount is applicable at this location. They also have crash pads available to rent for people who want to boulder outside but don’t want to have to buy them.</p>
            <p>On the first floor, there is a bouldering wall, top rope and auto belay sections, and the lead climbing section. There are a lot of auto belay options, which I feel is pretty rare. In most gyms, there are maybe one or two auto belays, but they have over ten. This is great for people who don’t want to boulder but might not have someone to belay them. I thought the auto belay routes were fun; there are some challenging ones, not just routes I would consider “warm-up” or “kid” climbs. I have not had a chance to top rope or lead climb, but those routes looked fun, and there was some variety in the setting styles. The bouldering wall on this floor has overhang or more neutral climbs and has a variety of setting styles. I noticed that the grades at this gym are some of the toughest I’ve seen; this will vary based on gym and setters but I felt like for example some of the v4s felt more like v5s etc. That isn’t a bad thing though, and made me check my ego at the door.</p>

            <p>The second floor has even more auto belay routes, another boulder wall, and a small strength section. These auto belay walls are short and seem to be catered toward kids. The bouldering section is mainly slab climbs but mixes in some fun dyno moves that I really enjoy. Next to the bouldering wall is a super small strength section that has a campus board, two hang boards, a set of rings, a pull-up bar, dumbbells, and a bench. This is my least favorite part of the gym; I love to lift and do not think I would be satisfied with a strength workout in here. There is a sign that says parties, strength classes, and yoga classes head up to the third floor, and I have not made my way up there because there is always an event going on. There may be some more equipment up there that I am not giving them credit for, but the main section on the second floor is lacking nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Even though there are multiple floors, it gets cramped fairly easily. The floor space is limited, so if you go on a weeknight it's going to be packed with people coming after work and school, and the climbing team has practices on certain nights which adds to the crowd. As someone who gets anxious in big crowds, this was a bit overwhelming. However, I know myself so I know not to go at those times. For people who climb for the social aspect, this is probably a really good thing because there are so many friendly faces to talk to while you climb. This is the gym I would consider my “home gym” though. I always have a great time bouldering here, and it has been the gym I go to the most because of how easy it is to get to.</p>
