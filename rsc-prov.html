            <h2>Rock Spot Climbing: Providence</h2>
            <p>The first location I went to was Rock Spot Climbing: Providence. I didn’t do a whole lot of research on this location before coming, so I was overjoyed to see that this gym was completely dedicated to bouldering. As someone who prefers bouldering over rope climbing this was like my dream. They had sections for overhang, slab, and vert walls, and the routes had a lot of variation in each section. I felt like there was a good mix of hold types throughout the gym, and that the grading was fair. I spent a lot of time on the slab wall because they had very creative problems, which sometimes I think gyms lack when it comes to slab.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Aside from the main wall, Rock Spot Providence also had a campus board, a moon board, a kilter board, and a tread wall. Most gyms have a campus board, and it made sense that they had one in a bouldering-only gym. The moonboard and the kilter board have similar functions, but with different holds and apps to connect to. I chose not to use either of these because I have used them both at other gyms before and did not want to waste my energy that could be used trying out the main wall. However they are a great addition to the gym; both of these boards are extremely useful for bouldering training because they add seemingly unlimited routes to a gym, and help train technique, strength, and endurance.</p>

            <p>The tread wall also helps train endurance, and I was super excited to see that this gym had one because I had never seen one in person before. A tread wall is essentially an upright treadmill with rock climbing holds on it that climbers use to train their endurance. I did not use it for the same reason I did not use the moon or kilter boards, but I spoke to the guy a the front desk about it. He said that they usually only use it with the climbing team, and agreed that it is a useful endurance tool. Since this gym does not have a top rope section, which some boulderers use to train their endurance, the treadwall is a great addition. There is also a small weights section in this gym, equipped with hang boards, pull-up bars, a full squat rack and bench, dumbbells, and resistance bands. Even though it is a fairly small strength area, everything I look for in a weight room is there.</p>

            <p>This gym is the smallest one that I went to, so I was not surprised to see that they only had a small lobby area. It was just a few chairs, a coffee table, and a small couch. This little lobby made the space feel welcoming though, especially after walking past all of the literal warning signs. When I first arrived at this location, I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of parking available. There were some spots on the street right out front and a designated lot for customers of the climbing gym. After I got over the rush of finding an amazing parking spot, I slowly noticed all of the signs around the lot saying to hide belongings in your car, make sure your doors are locked and keys are away, and the gym is not responsible for stolen belongings. This caught me off guard and had me walking inside a little quicker than normal. When I got to the doors I was greeted with another sign about thefts, and yet another sign at the front desk when I was checking in. All of these signs stuck with me the entire time I was climbing, and I found it very hard to ignore. I knew in the back of my mind that it was the middle of the day and nothing was going to happen, but it was nagging at me during my entire session. </p>
            <p> Overall, I was impressed with this gym. It is a small but mighty bouldering gym that houses all the tools a boulderer needs to succeed, just maybe in a rougher area than some may prefer.</p>
