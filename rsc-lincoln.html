            <h2>Rock Spot Climbing: Lincoln</h2>
            <p>The next gym on my climbing adventure was Rock Spot Climbing: Lincoln. The gym is in kind of an awkward spot, it’s halfway up a hill, so I think they did a good job utilizing the space. For parking, there are two handicap spots right out front, a couple more regular spots, and a larger lot further up the hill that you can get up and down using the stairs next to the building. They have a sign on the door explaining the parking situation which I may have needed if I hadn’t been able to snag a spot in front, but that map might be more useful online.</p>
            <p>There are two bouldering sections in this gym, a few auto belay stations, top rope sections, and a lead climbing area. It felt like the main focus of this gym was the rope climbing areas, and the boulders were a secondary focus. That is not to say that I did not have fun with the boulders; the routes were creative and enjoyable, and they maximize the minimal bouldering space available. The main boulder arch is right next to the doors, and this is where I spent the majority of my time. This wall is mostly overhang, and there was a great range of difficulty in the route setting. The second boulder section is mixed in with the lead climbing cave, which is something I have seen in a lot of gyms. How this works is the boulders and lead climbs start in the same spot, but the boulder problems have finish holds marked at a certain height while the lead routes for the same problem keep going up. I did not see anyone lead climbing the day that I went, and I’m not lead certified yet so I couldn't try them out myself. There were some little kids on the auto belays and they were having a blast, and a couple probably around my age was climbing near me on some of the top ropes. I did not want to pay extra to have a staff belay me on the top ropes, but from the ground the routes looked fun and the couple climbing was saying that there are some challenging climbs throughout the gym.</p>

            <p>Out of the three Rock Spot gyms in Rhode Island, I would put their strength section in second place. You cannot access it if there is a birthday party going on upstairs, which there was for most of my visit, but they have a good amount of dumbbells, three cardio machines, some yoga balls, medicine balls, pull-up bars, hang boards, and what seemed like a bouldering technique training wall.</p>

            <p>There is a gear shop by the front desk, and Rock Spot Climbing members get a discount on anything there. They have shoes, apparel, chalk, and some other items a climber may need. The membership discount is a great perk because climbing gear is expensive. There was a poster in the bathroom and by the front door advertising that at a few of the local restaurants Rock Spot members can get 15% off. This is such a fun way to get people to eat at places in their community and support small businesses.</p>

            <p>This gym has its charms, but it was not my favorite. If I was more of a top roper instead of a boulderer I may have enjoyed it more, but as a boulderer I felt like this was not the gym for me. As creative as the routes were, there were not as many options compared to other gyms.</p>
