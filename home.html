            <h2>Why I Chose This?</h2>
            <p>After I moved in this September, one of the first things I wanted to do was find the closest rock climbing gym near me so I could get a membership. Rock climbing is my main hobby and a stress reliever for me, so I needed to find a local place. I have a pretty busy schedule with lacrosse and classes, and I donâ€™t want to have to drive over 30 minutes to and from the gym. Another bit of inspiration for this project was my Europe trip this past summer. Every place we went to I would find the closest gym and go try it out, and I had so much fun seeing new gyms.</p>

            <h2>My Climbing Background</h2>
            <p>I have been climbing since 2021. During the school year I try to climb about twice a week, but during the summer I climb about four times a week. The highest grade I have been able to climb is a v6, and I can consitently get v5s.</p>
